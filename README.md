#carpool Graph

###Description 
---
this c++ class is developed to simply solve a carpooling problem in an optemized way  
The shortest path is calculated using **Bellmann-Ford**' s algorithm.  
The input file has 3 logical units : 
  * `AdjacencyList` 
  * `Demands`
  * `Offers`
  
---
For example the adjacency list' s unit is as follow :
```python
@AdjacencyList:
a->b:3
a->d:1
b->c:2
@end
```

this will construct the following Graph :

![Graph](https://github.com/afritfr/carpool/blob/master/images/example.png)  

`BEWARE : a single line shooldn't hold more than `**one**` edge description ( a->b:3 )` 

the weight on the graph represent the distance

---
The Demands unit looks like this :  
```python
@Demands:
a->c
b->c
@end
```

---

The Offers unit :  
```python
@Offers:
a->c:4
d->b:1
@end
```

the weight here represent the number of available seats per offer

Go ahead and check the example input file [`test.txt`](https://github.com/afritfr/carpool/blob/master/test.txt) and the output file [`result.txt`](https://github.com/afritfr/carpool/blob/master/result.txt) produced by the main()   

The Graph that is generated by the `test.txt` looks like this :

###We have mainly two methods : 
  * `tryToSatisfyDemandsKeepingTheShortestPath`
  * `tryToSatisfyAllDemands`

The first one is going to keep drivers shortest path intact and try to pick up clients on the way,unlike the second one which is going to try to satisfy all demands regardless of the drivers'shrortest path whenever it is possible.

I figured that it would be nice to have colorized output.

here is my terminal output : for the same example after calling `showGraphContent` ,`tryToSatisfyDemandsKeepingTheShortestPath`and `tryToSatisfyAllDemands` :

###Other useful methods:  
  * `pathWeight` 
  * `showGraphContent`
  * `printShortestPathFromto`
